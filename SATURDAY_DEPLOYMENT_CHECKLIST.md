## 📋 Saturday Morning Checklist

### **Step 1: Receive Logo (Wait for Designer)** ⏳

**What you need:**
- [ ] Logo SVG file (vector format)
- [ ] Logo PNG files:
  - [ ] 512x512 (high res)
  - [ ] 180x180 (Apple touch icon)
  - [ ] 32x32 (favicon)
  - [ ] 16x16 (favicon)
- [ ] Favicon ICO file (optional, can generate from PNG)

**If designer only provides one file:**
Use https://realfavicongenerator.net to create all sizes

---

### **Step 2: Add Logo to Website (30 minutes)** ⏳

**Commands:**
```powershell
cd C:\Veera\avinshi

# Create logo structure if not exists
mkdir -Force website\assets\logo
mkdir -Force website\assets\favicon

# Copy logo files from designer
# (Adjust path to wherever designer sends them)
Copy-Item "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\avinshi-logo.svg" website\assets\logo\
Copy-Item "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\avinshi-512.png" website\assets\logo\
Copy-Item "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\favicon-*.png" website\assets\favicon\
Copy-Item "C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\favicon.ico" website\assets\favicon\
```

**Then update website/index.html:**

Add to `<head>` section (after line 6):
```html
<!-- Favicon -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="assets/favicon/favicon.ico">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="assets/favicon/favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="assets/favicon/favicon-16x16.png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="assets/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png">
```

**Optional:** Add logo to navigation (replace text logo):
Find line ~30 in index.html (nav section):
```html
<!-- Change this: -->
<a href="#" class="brand-name">avinshi</a>

<!-- To this: -->
<a href="#" class="brand-logo">
    <img src="assets/logo/avinshi-logo.svg" alt="avinshi" height="32">
</a>
```

**Test locally:**
```powershell
# Open in browser to verify logo shows
Start-Process website\index.html
```

**Commit and push:**
```powershell
git add website/assets/
git add website/index.html
git commit -m "Add logo and favicon"
git push
```

---

### **Step 3: Prepare for GitHub Pages Deployment (10 minutes)** ⏳

GitHub Pages can deploy from a **private repo** to a **public website**!

**Create docs folder (GitHub Pages source):**
```powershell
cd C:\Veera\avinshi

# Create docs folder and copy website
mkdir docs
Copy-Item website\* docs\ -Recurse

# Create CNAME file for custom domain
echo "avinshi.com" > docs\CNAME

# Verify structure
Get-ChildItem docs -Recurse
```

**Expected structure:**
```
docs/
├── CNAME                    # Contains: avinshi.com
├── index.html               # Homepage with logo
└── assets/
    ├── style.css           # Design system
    ├── logo/
    │   └── avinshi-logo.svg
    └── favicon/
        ├── favicon.ico
        ├── favicon-32x32.png
        ├── favicon-16x16.png
        └── apple-touch-icon.png
```

**Commit docs folder:**
```powershell
git add docs/
git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment folder"
git push
```

---

### **Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages (5 minutes)** ⏳

**In Browser:**

1. **Go to repo settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/avinshi/avinshi/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Configure Pages:**
   - Source: ✅ Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: ✅ `main`
   - Folder: ✅ `/docs`
   - Click "Save"

3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment

4. **Check deployment status:**
   ```
   https://github.com/avinshi/avinshi/deployments
   ```

5. **Site will be live at:**
   ```
   https://avinshi.github.io/avinshi/
   ```

**Note:** This is temporary URL. Next step connects your custom domain.

---

### **Step 5: Configure Custom Domain (15 minutes)** ⏳

**In GitHub Pages Settings:**

1. **Go to Pages settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/avinshi/avinshi/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Add custom domain:**
   - Custom domain: `avinshi.com`
   - Click "Save"
   - Wait for DNS check

3. **Enable HTTPS:**
   - ✅ Check "Enforce HTTPS" (after DNS propagates)

**In AWS Route 53 (DNS Configuration):**

1. **Go to Route 53:**
   ```
   https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/
   ```

2. **Select hosted zone:** `avinshi.com`

3. **Create/Update A records:**
   
   **For apex domain (avinshi.com):**
   - Type: `A`
   - Name: `@` or leave blank
   - Value: Add these 4 IPs (GitHub Pages servers):
     ```
     185.199.108.153
     185.199.109.153
     185.199.110.153
     185.199.111.153
     ```
   - TTL: `300`

4. **Create/Update CNAME record:**
   
   **For www subdomain:**
   - Type: `CNAME`
   - Name: `www`
   - Value: `avinshi.github.io`
   - TTL: `300`

5. **Save changes**

**Verify DNS propagation (wait 5-10 minutes):**
```powershell
nslookup avinshi.com
# Should show GitHub IPs

nslookup www.avinshi.com
# Should show avinshi.github.io
```

---

### **Step 6: Test Live Site (10 minutes)** ⏳

**Open in multiple browsers:**
```powershell
Start-Process "https://avinshi.com"
Start-Process "https://www.avinshi.com"
```

**Test checklist:**
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] Logo displays correctly
- [ ] Favicon shows in browser tab
- [ ] All links work (GitHub, email, anchors)
- [ ] Mobile responsive (resize browser)
- [ ] SSL certificate valid (green padlock 🔒)
- [ ] Navigation smooth scrolling works
- [ ] Stats section displays correctly
- [ ] Comparison table readable
- [ ] Footer links work

**Test on mobile:**
- [ ] Open on phone/tablet
- [ ] Check responsive design
- [ ] Test touch interactions

**Check PageSpeed:**
```
https://pagespeed.web.dev/
```
- Target: 90+ score

**Check social preview:**
```
https://metatags.io/
```
- Enter: https://avinshi.com
- Verify Open Graph tags

---

### **Step 7: Final Verification (5 minutes)** ⏳

**Verify privacy settings:**
- [ ] GitHub repo still PRIVATE
- [ ] Website is PUBLIC (anyone can visit avinshi.com)
- [ ] Platform code NOT visible to public
- [ ] Only website files deployed

**Check what's visible:**
```
Public (anyone can see):
✅ https://avinshi.com (website)
✅ Website HTML/CSS source (via browser inspector)

Private (only you can see):
🔒 https://github.com/avinshi/avinshi (repo)
🔒 platform/ folder with agent code
🔒 All Python files
🔒 Configuration files
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: GitHub Pages not deploying**

**Check:**
```powershell
# Verify docs folder exists and has content
Get-ChildItem C:\Veera\avinshi\docs

# Check git status
cd C:\Veera\avinshi
git status

# Verify pushed to GitHub
git log --oneline -n 5
```

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Force push if needed
git push -f origin main

# Check GitHub Actions
# Visit: https://github.com/avinshi/avinshi/actions
```

---

### **Issue: Custom domain not working**

**Check DNS:**
```powershell
nslookup avinshi.com
```

**Should return GitHub IPs:**
```
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

**If not:**
- Wait 10-15 minutes for DNS propagation
- Verify Route 53 A records correct
- Check CNAME file exists in docs/

---

### **Issue: HTTPS not working**

**Solution:**
- Wait 24 hours for SSL certificate
- GitHub generates it automatically
- Must have valid DNS first

---

### **Issue: Logo not showing**

**Check paths:**
```powershell
# Verify logo files exist
Get-ChildItem C:\Veera\avinshi\docs\assets\logo
Get-ChildItem C:\Veera\avinshi\docs\assets\favicon

# Check HTML paths match
cat C:\Veera\avinshi\docs\index.html | Select-String "logo"
```

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Ensure paths are relative (not absolute)
# Correct: assets/logo/avinshi-logo.svg
# Wrong: /assets/logo/avinshi-logo.svg
```
